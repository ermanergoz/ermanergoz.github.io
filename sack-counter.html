                    <p>Sack Counter is an application I made for a sugar factory line located in Ankara/Turkey while I
                        worked for Teknikcell SeoWarp Yazılım Eğitim Danışmanlık Tic. Paz. Ltd. Şti. This
                        application is made to be run on Orange Pi with cameras attached to it using ML-Kit by
                        Google.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>About</h4>
                    <p>The job was about creating a sack counter for a sugar factory line. They already had such a
                        system before but, due to the poor implementation, it did not detect two sacks that are too
                        close to each other. The task was to create an Android application to be run on Orange Pi with
                        cameras attached to it, count the sacks properly, and make an API call using Wi-Fi to report the
                        number of sacks counted to the server.</p>

                    <p>To accomplish this task, I used Ml Kit object detection and tracking with Camera X. The
                        application supports Android SDK level 21 (Android 5.0) and above. Since the sacks don’t have an
                        exact shape and fixed properties, I had to train a custom AI model using TensorFlow Lite.</p>

                    <p>To be able to build a custom machine learning model that provides accurate results and to avoid
                        the underfitting, I had to gather a large dataset containing the images of the sacks and the
                        boxes with different lighting, angles, and colors (About 900 images of sacks and 600 images of
                        boxes). After I gathered the images, I used the UNIX terminal to resize them to make the
                        training process faster without sacrificing accuracy.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>After I applied the custom trained TensorFlow Lite model to the application, I used CameraX library to
                track the detected items. When a sack enters the scope of the camera on the production line, it is
                detected, being tracked, and is assigned an id. In case of a defective sack/box, a worker removes it
                from the production line, and it won’t be counted. Otherwise, the sack gets out of the scope of the
                camera, and the counter is increased by one.</p>

            <p>The application makes an API call every five minutes to report the number sacks
                counted to the server. The hostname can be edited from the
                settings. In case of a Wi-Fi loss or an unexpected reboot, the application makes an API call as soon as
                the device connects to Wi-Fi again or as soon as the device boots to prevent data loss. Only in case of
                a successful API call, the counter is reset.</p>
